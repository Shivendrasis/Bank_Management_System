üèõÔ∏è Simple Bank Account Management System

I'd be glad to create a comprehensive README file for your Java code on GitHub:

This Java program implements a basic bank account management system that allows users to:

üí∞ Create a bank account with an initial balance.
Deposit funds into the account.
Withdraw funds from the account (with insufficient balance checks).
Check the current account balance.
Features:

üòä User-friendly menu-driven interface for easy interaction.
Input validation for account number and balance values (ensures positive values).
Clear and informative messages for each action.
